MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Model - A data object
View - UI
ViewModel - Business logic (UI handling)

View is completely decoupled, and knows nothing about the ViewModel. Same with ViewModel to View
Model should be lightweight with data and validation
ViewModel - takes user input and manipulates, saves, loads data etc
Model and ViewModel can be coupled
